Three different kinds of methods of sliding window. you can see seperated files for each algorithm
1.	2x2 sliding window

2.	3x3 sliding window using extension principle of 2x2

3.	3x3 sliding window method with eight rules

  * rules of 3x3 sliding window.PNG
  * (update for rules. In this solution, two collection of rules are used to make decision but it can be
     more than two for better detection. According to the paper of Begol, Moslem and Maghooli,Keivan, 'Improving Digital Image Edge 
     Detection by Fuzzy Systems' World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology International Journal of Computer,
     Electrical, Automation, Control and Information Engineering Vol:5, No:9, 2011. For quick info i will add 'updaterules.png' file 
     which is prt sc of the rules part of the paper)
