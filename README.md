# Fuzzy_Edge_Detection
Edge Detection using Fuzzy Logic
Different kinds of solution from literature will be applied. An application for comparing classic methods for edge detection and proposed algorithm.

# EdgeDetectors
A GUI is to compare classical edge detection methods like Canny, Sobel, Prewitt, Kirsch  and Fuzzy Edge Detection methods like sliding window and gradient. Some screenshots from the demo as below
